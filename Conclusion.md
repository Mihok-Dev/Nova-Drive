​Chapter 5: Results and Conclusion
​5.1. Measured Impact
​During the test cycles, the Nova-Drive protocol successfully maintained engine stability while reducing the specific fuel consumption (SFC). The average efficiency gain was recorded at 9.5%, directly correlating with a significant reduction in particulate matter and CO2 output.
​5.2. Earth Healing Perspective
​The mission of mihok-div is to provide a non-monopolized solution for the aging global fleet. By licensing this technology openly, we ensure:
​Immediate reduction in global carbon footprint without the need for expensive new vehicle manufacturing.
​Healing of the atmosphere through cleaner combustion cycles in legacy engines.
​Economic accessibility for developing regions, ensuring no one is left behind in the green transition.
​5.3. Final Remarks
​The Nova-Drive project proves that through precision software engineering and molecular optimization, we can bridge the gap between legacy technology and a sustainable future.
