​Chapter 2: Theoretical Background
​2.1. Thermal Efficiency in Internal Combustion Engines (ICE)
​The efficiency of a legacy ICE is primarily limited by the Carnot cycle and mechanical friction losses. Most engines from the 2000-2015 era operate at an average thermal efficiency of 28-32%. The remaining energy is lost as heat or unburned hydrocarbons.
​2.2. The Role of Injection Timing
​The Nova-Protocol targets the "Injection Window." By advancing or retarding the start of injection (SOI) based on real-time RPM data, we can maximize the peak cylinder pressure relative to the piston position. This ensures that more fuel energy is converted into kinetic energy (torque) rather than waste heat.
​2.3. Molecular Fuel Conditioning
​Standard fuel molecules often form clusters that do not burn completely. By introducing a conditioning phase (simulated in our logic), we improve the surface-area-to-volume ratio of the fuel droplets, leading to a more complete combustion.
